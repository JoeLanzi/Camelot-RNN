Completed Task:
- Started developing environment and agent simulations
- Utilized Reinforcement Learning algorihtms to create model used in the simulations
- Successfully built a mock environment for running test and simulations
- Successfully created a model that can "survive" much better within the environment logic vs random action generators
- Created multiple models using PPO and A2C
- Create a domain model for the entire algorihtms


To be completed:
- Add wealth to environment logic & train/ test using simulations
- Create variability in environment
- Train more models and plot agent results


Problems:
- All problems the past few weeks have been resolved
- No problems at this time
